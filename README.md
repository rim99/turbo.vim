I missed the colors of Borland's Turbo Pascal and Turbo C++ for DOS, so I tried to duplicate them as well as I could remember them.

----------------

I found this Vim color theme from <vimcolors.com>.

I modified this theme to fit for my termianl's semi-transparent DARK PURPLE background.

I hope whoever is looking for the same thing is really enjoy this.
